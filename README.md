Procedurally Placing Game Elements in a game level in UE5

Aim ​

An analysis how to procedurally place game elements (Enemies and collectables) and create a tool that can procedurally place game elements in a 2D platformer level like Mario within UE5.

How it works
- Breaks a level down into sections​
- Works with any 2D level generated by the project one PCG ​
- Sections can check what has already been spawned ​
- In both checking the previous section so that it can adapt quickly ​
- But the section will also check what has been spawned in the entirety of the level​
